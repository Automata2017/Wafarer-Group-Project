        title: 'Sydney',
        Post1: 'Even though it is home to more than 4 million people, I had no sense of the big city while there. People went out of their way to be friendly, helpful and courteous. The city itself has easily available restrooms, walking paths, shade areas, information booths and food! It was clean, calm and beautiful! The botanical garden was amazing! We would love to go back!',

        title: 'Seattle',
        Post1: 'Pros: Fast paced. Good for young professionals who want to have a high paying career. Close to Canada. Getting to Hawaii or California is easy. Natural beauty, with snow capped mountains overlooking wide blue water. It is green, with plant life everywhere. Orcas and Sea Lions. Great food. Great coffee. Rich artistic community. Liberal. Diverse. Accepting. Well-educated populace. Adequate (but overrated) healthcare. Many options to do what you like to do, many groups to join.',
