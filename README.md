# Wayfarer-Group-Project
We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named Project Wayfarer for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world. A travel community for users to share city-specific tips ("posts" or "logs") about their favorite locations around the world.
